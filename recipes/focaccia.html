        <li>Oven</li>
        <li>9x13 inch tray that's at least 2 inches deep</li>
        <li>Bowls & Mesuring instruments (Spoons and scales).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>470g lukewarm water - should be somewhere between 27 and 37 degrees C</li>
        <li>11g salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil + plenty more for later</li>
        <li>7g dried active yeast</li>
        <li>560g bread (or any high protein) flour</li>
        <li>(OPTIONAL) Rosemary & Flaky Sea Salt for toppings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to create</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> <strong>Make the Dough</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine water, salt, olive oil, yeast and give it a good whisk.</li>
                <li>Add the bread flour, mix using large spoon or spatula until well combined and hydrated. Don't be
                    afraid if it seems to wet or sticky.</li>
                <li>Scrape down the sides and cover bowl for 30 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Streching and folding the Dough</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>We need to perform 4 rounds of 'strech and folds'.</li>
                <li>Take one side of the dough, strech and fold bringing the dough to the opposite side.</li>
                <li>Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat another 3 times.</li>
                <li>Cover the bowl and leave it for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Repeat this process another 3 times, leaving 30 minutes in between each round.</stron>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Allowing the dough to Proof</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>After completing the last of the strech and folds, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place in
                    fridge <strong>overnight</strong>.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li> <strong>Shaping focaccia and final proofing</strong>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the tray, add 3 to 4 tbsp of olive oil, making sure to be generous as focaccia really demands
                    it.</li>
                <li>Grease the tray well, and if your tray isn't non-stick, use parchment paper too.</li>
                <li>Perform one last series of strech and folds and place your focaccia carefully into the tray.</li>
                <li>Drizzle the top with some more olive oil.</li>
                <li>Cover this (I know) yet again, and allow to proof one last time for at least 2 hours at room
                    temperature.</li>
                <li>After this last proof, drizzle the dough with a bit more olive oil as well as your hands.</li>
                <li>Use your oil covered hands to add dimples into the dough, going deep to the bottom of the pan and
                    across the entire pan.</li>
                <li>Then use your fingers to jiggle the dough which will create these uneven surfaces and bubbles in
                    your dough. Do <strong>NOT</strong> burst these bubbles!</li>
                <li>Add toppings of your choice and preheat your oven to 200 C with the fan on (if available).</li>
                <li>Once up to temperature, put your pan in there on the middle shelf and bake for 20 to 25 minutes
                    until its golden and crispy.</li>
                <li>I recommend <strong>not</strong> to open the oven door after placing the tray in until the timer has
                    run out, to make sure it doesn't collapse.</li>
                <li>Remove it from the oven, immediately getting the focaccia out and onto a cooling tray so it doesn't
                    go soggy.</li>
                <li>Allow to cool for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and eating.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
